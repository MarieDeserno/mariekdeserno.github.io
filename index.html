		I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Dutch Autism & ADHD Research Centre (<a href="http://www.dutcharc.nl/">dâ€™Arc</a>) lab at the Department of Brain & Cognition at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). 
		As a clinical neuropsychologist with strong roots in psychological methods, I am interested in using complexity science and network theory to further the theory formation around autism and some of the most pressing issues in the autism realm. 
		I recently received my doctorate (cum laude) from the University of Amsterdam
