	<p> 
		I am a postdoctoral research in the Dutch Autism & ADHD Research Centre (d’Arc) lab at the Department of Brain & Cognition at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). 
		As a methodologist with strong roots in clinical neuropsychology I am interested in using complexity science and network theory to further the theory formation around autism and some of the most pressing issues in the autism realm. 
		I recently received my doctorate (cum laude) from the University of Amsterdam 
		based on my thesis titled <a href="https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=a6933d33-58d9-465a-b55f-a3d5d4b0e66c">Autism as a Multicausal System</a> which was supervised by <a href="http://www.dutcharc.nl/team/hilde-geurts/" <Prof. Hilde Geurts>/ a> (Brain & Cognition, UvA), Prof. Denny Borsboom (Psychological Methods, UvA) and Dr. Sander Begeer (Developmental Psychology, VU). <a href="/about">Read more...</a></p>
